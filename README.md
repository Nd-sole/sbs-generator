# Side-by-Side (SBS) 3D Video Generation Framework

## Introduction
This repository contains a framework for converting monocular videos into side-by-side (SBS) 3D videos. It utilizes a combination of image processing techniques and depth map predictions to generate separate views for each eye, creating a 3D effect when viewed with appropriate hardware.

## Installation
(Instructions on how to install and setup the framework, including dependencies like OpenCV, Typer, and ffmpeg.)

## Usage
(General instructions on how to use the framework, including command-line examples.)

## Scripts Description

### `sbs_rename_directory.py`
- **Purpose**: Renames files in a specified directory for consistent processing.
- **Usage**: (Example command and explanation of arguments.)

### `sbs_generate_stereoviews.py`
- **Purpose**: Generates left and right eye views from color and depth images.
- **Usage**: (Example command and explanation of arguments.)

### `sbs_inpaint_stereoviews.py`
- **Purpose**: Inpaints black streaks in left and right eye images.
- **Usage**: (Example command and explanation of arguments.)
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Enhanced error handling, optimizing mask creation, and performance optimization.

### `sbs-ffmpeg-shell.sh`
- **Purpose**: Utilizes ffmpeg to generate left and right eye videos and combine them into an SBS format.
- **Usage**: (Example command and explanation of arguments.)
